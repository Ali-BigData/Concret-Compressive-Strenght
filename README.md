# Concret Strenght

The Compressive Strength of Concrete determines the quality of Concrete. This is generally determined by a standard crushing test on a concrete cylinder. This requires engineers to build small concrete cylinders with different combinations of raw materials and test these cylinders for strength variations with a change in each raw material. The recommended wait time for testing the cylinder is 28 days to ensure correct results. This consumes a lot of time and requires a lot of labor to prepare different prototypes and test them. Also, this method is prone to human error and one small mistake can cause the wait time to drastically increase.

One way of reducing the wait time and reducing the number of combinations to try is to make use of digital simulations, Where can provide information of raw materials of concrete for training dataset in term of different features to predict the compressive strength. This way we can reduce the number of combinations we can try physically and reduce the amount of time for experimentation. In general, to design such software we have to know the relations between all the raw materials and how one material affects the strength. It is possible to derive mathematical equations and run simulations based on these equations, but we cannot expect the relations to be the same in the real world. In contrast, the number of experiments of testing data by various modeling and algorithms produced an accurate prediction of concrete strength. 

# Aim and objective of project 

The aim of this project is for training data throughout effective models which allow us to Concrete compressive strength accurately. The path to this goal lies through a deep understanding of the dataset and how features have an impact on Concrete compressive strength(MPa, megapascals) as performed different classifiers and algorithms for selecting the best-evaluation model to predict Concret compressive strenght.
